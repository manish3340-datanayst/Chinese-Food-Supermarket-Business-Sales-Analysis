# Chinese-Food-Supermarket-Business-Sales-Analysis

An End-to-End Data Analytics & Business Insights Project

# Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a hypothetical Chinese Food Supermarket with the goal of uncovering actionable business insights. The project covers the entire data analysis lifecycle — from data cleaning and transformation to visualization and storytelling — using tools such as Python, Power BI, and Excel.
The insights derived from this analysis can help supermarket managers and stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve profitability, optimize product assortment, and enhance the customer experience.

# Project Objectives
Analyze overall sales trends and seasonality
Identify top-performing products and product categories
Segment customers and analyze buying patterns
Provide actionable recommendations to improve business performance

# Data
The dataset simulates real-world Chinese supermarket transactions and contains information such as:
Product Category
Transaction Date
Store Location
Customer Type (Member/Non-Member)
Unit Price
Quantity
Total Sales
Gross Income
Payment Method

# Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Power BI (Interactive Dashboards)
Microsoft Excel (Initial Data Exploration & Cleaning)

# Project Workflow
